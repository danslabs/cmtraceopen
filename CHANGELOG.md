## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-28

### Highlights

First stable release. CMTrace Open 1.0.0 ships multi-file open and drag-drop, an inline Ctrl+F find bar with regex support, a Diagnostics Collection workspace (Windows-only), deeper Windows Setup log analysis with four new structured columns, a fix for the 4-hour timestamp display offset in Intune IME logs, and improved DSRegCmd MDM enrollment detection.

### Added

- **Multi-file open**: The file open dialog now supports selecting multiple log files at once. Drag-and-dropping multiple files merges them into a unified view. Launching the app from the command line with multiple paths loads all files simultaneously.
- **Inline find bar** (Ctrl+F): A persistent find bar slides in at the bottom of the log workspace. Supports plain-text and regex search with live match highlighting. Navigate matches with F3 / Shift+F3. Invalid regex patterns display a clear inline error rather than failing silently.
- **Diagnostics Collection workspace** (Windows-only): New "Collect Diagnostics" command in the Tools menu opens a dialog with category presets (Full, Intune + Autopilot, Networking, Security, Quick) and a granular family-level category tree. Collection runs concurrently and emits real-time progress events. A completion summary shows per-type artifact counts (logs, registry, event logs, exports, commands), total duration, and gap details. The bundle output folder can be opened directly into the log workspace from the summary dialog. The embedded profile covers 32 log patterns, 61 registry keys, 42 event log channels, and 30 command outputs across Intune, Autopilot, networking, security, BitLocker, Windows Update, ConfigMgr, and general diagnostics categories.
- **GUID-to-app-name registry**: App/GUID resolution is now consolidated into a single ranked registry (by source confidence: ApplicationName > NameField > SetUpFilePath) and serialized to the frontend. Download stats and event tracking both draw from the same source, eliminating duplicate lookups and surfacing richer app names in the Intune workspace.
- **Panther parser — four new columns**: `result_code`, `gle_code`, `setup_phase`, and `operation_name` are extracted from Windows Setup (`setupact.log` / `setuperr.log`) message text using targeted regex patterns and surfaced as detail columns.
- **Panther parser — source and thread enrichment**: `source_file` is populated from `[exe.exe]` bracketed tags and `CClassName::MethodName(line):` patterns in message text. `thread` is populated from DISM `TID=` fields. `Perf`-level messages are now correctly classified as Info.
- **InfoPane metadata row**: When a selected log entry has a result code, GLE code, setup phase, or operation name, a compact `Result | GLE | Phase | Op` summary line is shown at the top of the detail pane.

### Fixed

- **IME log timestamp display** (4-hour offset): Intune IME logs omit the timezone offset from the `time=` field, causing timestamps to be stored as UTC and displayed shifted by the local UTC offset (e.g., 4 hours early for EDT users). The parser now falls back to the machine's local timezone when no offset is present in the log.
- **CCM/SCCM log timestamp display**: Timestamps in logs that embed a timezone offset (e.g., `+240` for UTC-4 in Windows bias convention) are now correctly converted to UTC before display. Extreme or malformed offsets fall back safely to UTC rather than panicking.
- **DSRegCmd MDM enrollment detection**: The DSRegCmd workspace now cross-references scheduled tasks under `\Microsoft\Windows\EnterpriseMgmt\` against `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Enrollments\{GUID}` (checking `EnrollmentState=1`) to confirm active enrollment when `dsregcmd /status` output lacks MDM URLs. This eliminates false "enrollment missing" warnings on enrolled devices.
- **Log row scroll suppression on click**: Clicking an already-visible row no longer causes an unexpected scroll jump. Scroll suppression now only activates when a click changes the selected entry, leaving keyboard and programmatic navigation unaffected.

### Changed

- **TypeScript 6.0**: Frontend toolchain upgraded from TypeScript 5.9.3 to 6.0.2 with no source changes required.

### Build

- Hardened Windows build prerequisites script (`Install-CMTraceOpenBuildPrereqs.ps1`) for fresh machines where Visual Studio is absent — resolves null-array crash and `vswhere.exe` not-found errors on clean systems.
- Winget package detection now queries `winget list` once and checks all packages against a cached in-memory set, eliminating N individual subprocess invocations.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-24

### Highlights

Major UX overhaul and parser expansion. The log viewer now has dynamic columns derived from the detected parser, a severity icon column, resizable and reorderable columns, a collapsible sidebar, workspace dropdown, multi-file tabs, and a font family picker. Five new log parsers added. The Software Deployment workspace now analyzes folders for MSI/PSADT/Burn deployment outcomes.

### Added

- **Workspace dropdown**: Replaced 5 workspace buttons with a single dropdown selector.
- **Log file tabs**: Tab strip below the toolbar for switching between multiple open log files with overflow dropdown.
- **Dynamic columns**: Columns are now derived automatically from the detected parser — plain text shows only the message column, CCM shows component/dateTime/thread/sourceFile.
- **Severity icon column**: Colored dot (red/yellow/gray) as the leftmost column, always visible.
- **Timestamp-first layout**: Date/Time column now appears before Log Text by default.
- **Resizable columns**: Drag column header borders to resize any column, including Log Text. Widths persist.
- **Reorderable columns**: Drag column headers to reorder. Order persists.
- **Collapsible sidebar**: Chevron button or Ctrl+B to collapse/expand the sidebar. State persists.
- **Font family picker**: Choose any system font in the Accessibility dialog. Font applies to entire app and persists.
- **macOS Intune MDM Daemon parser**: Dedicated parser for pipe-delimited `/Library/Logs/Microsoft/Intune/IntuneMDMDaemon*.log` files. Extracts process, severity, thread, sub-component.
- **Windows DHCP Server parser**: Dedicated parser for `DhcpSrvLog-*.log` and `DhcpV6SrvLog-*.log` with IP Address, Host Name, and MAC Address columns.
- **WiX/Burn bootstrapper parser**: Dedicated parser for `[PID:TID][ISO-timestamp]sNNN:` format logs (vc_redist, .NET runtime, etc.).
- **MSI verbose log parser**: Handles ~12 line patterns including engine messages, action tracking, property dumps, and `MainEngineThread` return values.
- **PSADT Legacy format parser**: Parses `[timestamp] [section] [source] [severity] :: message` logs from PSAppDeployToolkit v4.
- **IME subsystem enrichment**: Extracts `[Subsystem]` prefixes (Win32App, PowerShell, Flighting, etc.) from IME log messages into the Source column.
- **Deployment workspace backend**: `analyze_deployment_folder` Rust command scans folders recursively, classifies format/outcome, extracts exit codes, generates error summaries with error code lookup.
- **PatchMyPC known sources**: Added PatchMyPC Logs Folder and PatchMyPC Install Logs to the Known Sources menu.
- **Batch file parsing**: Single IPC call parses all files in a folder via Rayon parallel processing.
- **Tab entry caching**: Parsed file entries cached in memory for instant tab switching (zero re-parse).
- **Folder load progress overlay**: Full-screen ProgressBar + Spinner during folder loading.

### Changed

- **Toolbar reorganization**: Moved Pause/Refresh/Streaming to sidebar footer, removed Highlight label, replaced native selects with Fluent UI Menu/Dropdown components, pushed Theme to far right.
- **Known Log Sources**: Menu dynamically populated from the full catalog instead of hardcoded single item.

### Performance

- **Zero-allocation severity detection**: Replaced `.to_lowercase()` with byte-level ASCII case folding — eliminates heap allocation per log line.
- **Cached thread display**: `format_thread_display()` cached with thread-local HashMap — ~15 allocations instead of ~30K per file.
- **Combined Simple parser regex**: Merged timestamp and thread regexes into single pass.
- **Error code pre-check**: Fast `"0x"` substring check before running regex on every log line.
- **Timestamped format caching**: Detected format reused for subsequent lines — avoids up to 3 wasted regex attempts per line.

### Fixed

- Dark mode fixes for Accessibility, Filter, ErrorLookup, About, and FileAssociation dialogs.
- Log row height calculation corrected to prevent overlap at larger font sizes.
- Tab strip overflow dropdown now works (was clipped by `overflow: hidden`).
- Sidebar routing for deployment and macOS workspaces (was falling through to DSRegCmd).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-13

### Highlights

CMTrace Open 0.3.0 expands the app from a log viewer with Intune diagnostics into a broader troubleshooting tool for Windows management and identity issues. This release adds a dedicated DSRegCmd troubleshooting workspace, supports startup file handling through Windows file association flows, and prepares signed Windows release artifacts for easier distribution in managed environments.

### Added

- Added a dedicated DSRegCmd troubleshooting workspace for `dsregcmd /status` analysis.
- Added live DSRegCmd capture support so local troubleshooting can collect command output directly from the app.
- Added support for loading DSRegCmd data from pasted text, standalone text captures, and evidence bundles.
- Added bundle-aware DSRegCmd source resolution so the app can recognize valid bundle roots, `evidence` folders, and `command-output` folders.
- Added registry-backed Windows Hello for Business evidence loading using PolicyManager exports and Windows policy hives.
- Added support for Microsoft policy hive correlation under PassportForWork locations such as `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Policies\PassportForWork` and `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Policies\PassportForWork`.
- Added richer DSRegCmd diagnostics including join posture interpretation, failure phase detection, capture confidence, PRT state, MDM signal evaluation, certificate checks, and NGC/Windows Hello context.
- Added a DSRegCmd troubleshooting guide in [DSREGCMD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](DSREGCMD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) with walkthroughs and screenshots for the new workspace.
- Added Windows runtime file association handling for `.log` and `.lo_` files.
- Added a standalone prompt flow that can offer to associate log files with CMTrace Open.
- Added startup file-path handoff so the app can consume an associated file path once on launch and route it through the normal open flow.
- Added signed Windows release packaging coverage in the release workflow for x64 and arm64 artifacts.

### Improved

- Improved support for UTF-16 registry export files so `reg.exe export` artifacts can be parsed reliably.
- Improved the startup experience for associated log-file opens by routing them through the same frontend source-loading flow used for other file opens.

### Documentation

- Added end-user documentation for the DSRegCmd troubleshooting workspace.
- Expanded the project’s troubleshooting story beyond log parsing to include device-identity and Windows Hello investigations.

### Notes For Upgraders

- Existing log-viewing and Intune analysis workflows remain intact.
- Windows users opening `.log` or `.lo_` files through Explorer can now route those files directly into CMTrace Open after association is enabled.
- DSRegCmd troubleshooting is most effective when using live capture or a complete evidence bundle that includes registry artifacts.
